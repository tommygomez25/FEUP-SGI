### [TP2](tp2)
- Our scene is at night time with the stars and the moon in the sky. [README](tp2/README.md) with screenshots.
- Nice neighborhood with a house, a car, one big sidewalk all the way from the house to the street. There is also a car parked on the side of the house.
- The street has 2 sidewalks, one on each side, and a road in the middle. There are also some trees on the side of the road and some street lights.
- House:
  - The house is composed of 6 rectangles, forming a cube. This way, we could add different textures to each side of the house.
  - The house front wall has bump texture and mipmaps.
  - We also used bump textures on the house, roof and sidewalk.
- Additional functionalities:
  - Triangle geometry
  - Buffer geometry
  - UI to change cameras


- Tree:
  - We used lods for the tree. When the camera is far away, the tree is represented by a simple box. When the camera is closer, the tree is represented by a more complex model.

- Lights:
  - We used spotlights for the street lights to better represent reality.
  - There are also 2 directional lights, to represent the light from the moon and the stars.
